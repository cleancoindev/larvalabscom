		<description><![CDATA[&quot;As of right now there appears to be no workaround as this is an intentional change to restrict access to the data.&quot;

I am a huge fan of Slidescreen. I did some beta testing, I bought it when you released it in the Market, but I can&#039;t help but feel that you guys really saw this as an opportunity to stop developing a project you aren&#039;t all that enthusiastic about.

Don&#039;t get me wrong - you absolutely have that right. But I feel like if you wanted to move forward, you would say &quot;we&#039;re looking into other options&quot; or even just &quot;wait and see&quot; instead of &quot;they killed it, we&#039;re done.&quot; Perhaps third party app support for email, a la Twidroyd?

At the very least I appreciate that you were willing to keep the beta available. How about making it open source? If you&#039;re not going to move forward with Slidescreen, it would mean a lot for the people who loved it (personally, I can&#039;t imagine going back to a normal home screen. Normal home screens are inefficient and boring) if you would find a way to let the project live on, even if you don&#039;t want to move forward with it.]]></description>
