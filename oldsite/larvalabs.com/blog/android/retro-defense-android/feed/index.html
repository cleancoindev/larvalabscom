		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sure you have reasons for it, but I mailed you the other day asking if I could pay you via PayPal and download it from your server.

It would obviously require some level of trust that I didn&#039;t share it, but sharing it wouldn&#039;t benefit me. Buying this game directly from you would (i&#039;m also in a country that doesn&#039;t have paid apps in the market place)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We haven&#039;t put it up for sale anywhere else than the catalog for now, no. It just doesn&#039;t seem like there&#039;s enough interest to justify setting up another place of purchase. It&#039;s crazy they haven&#039;t gotten UK paid apps support yet though, I thought they had already done that a while ago.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Is it possible for people in a non-paid-apps-country to purchase the full version form a kind of web shop? I really love the lite version and would love to spend a few bucks on the full version, but unfortunately I can&#039;t. :-( 

And I have no idea when paid apps will be possible in Belgium.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Matt, we don&#039;t have any control over what payment methods are accepted unfortunately. I have heard some rumors that T-Mobile is planning on supporting integrated billing, so maybe it will be as easy as adding it to your bill in the future. Sorry about that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m also in the UK, with a Solo card, and looking to buy the full version. 

Can you lot give Google a nudge to find out what&#039;s going on with this? I can use my Solo card for Paypal purchases and the like, just not on the Market. Pretty sure I&#039;ve brought things in US$ via Google Checkout on my desktop as well. 

Is there a chance you could get Google to set you up a duplicate account with a UK registration as a workaround or anything similar? It&#039;s bloody annoying not being able to pay money I&#039;ve got for apps I want.]]></description>
