		<description><![CDATA[Hi, probably the best place to stay up to date on the app&#039;s progress is at our support site: http://getsatisfaction.com/larvalabs You can pretty much tell what&#039;s coming next from the messages there, and we always post a change list from each version there.

As for the Pro version, we want people to be able to try it to see if it works on their phone before they buy it, so for now it&#039;s got all the features. However, you&#039;re losing around 15% of the information you can display there so it&#039;s really a lot better without the ad.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey there,

first off: Great app, I really enjoy it.

I was wondering, when we will see a feature-update?

In addition, do you plan do update SlideScreen on a regular basis, like every month or so?

I am really considering buying it, but since the Pro version &quot;only&quot; removes the ads, I am not sure, if it&#039;s worth it.

No doubt about the app itself, which is great, but the Pro-version has nearly no difference, that justifies the prize.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello,

I have upgraded to the latest version of slide screen and it seems very, very laggy. The performance seems significantly degraded from the previous version, so much that I feel that I need to revert back to the regular Android Home Screen.

Very Disappointing,

Evan]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Got the Pro version on my myTouch and it seems to take for ever to load the home screen when I press home. Also, it crashes once in a while giving me an option to either force close or wait... takes about a minute or litter more to go to the home screen even after force closing! this is version 1.1.4]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great app, and I&#039;ll buy it for sure when it has support for Exchange email. I don&#039;t really use gmail, so I have to admit I was a bit disappointed about that.
