		<description><![CDATA[What the hell is wrong with the laser bot? I can&#039;t get it to fire. I&#039;ve checked it&#039;s range (assuming range is when you long-press on it and every lit up square is a square it can shoot at), it hasn&#039;t moved but there&#039;s no attack command coming up!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[on the “Venusian Invasion” I had a blast trying to win this one. What I did was send 1 soldier squad to the factory and one to the boats and take the two repairing stations. while the AI is still building whatever I put in two soldier squads in a boat and send them to their base, all while building up my defenses in the middle as to block the mountain pass. I usually used warbots for the block and sniper bots inside to keep the guys coming in from across the mountains. by the time I get my two units in the boat to their side I have a nice warbot switch where one takes the hits, two wait behind to swap when the other is almost died. I also have 1 or 2 bombbots behind pounding away at the enemy. then I have my two guys exit the boat and take over the airship place while the other is a distraction. I then build an airship and its almost over. then I just press on the AI till they give and win the map. I had a glitch once where the AI would build about 10 megabots and send them to the higher part of the map trying to get across the mountains somehow.... I terrorized them with an airship which was fun. 
one strategy is not to kill the bot all the way. the AI never lets the bot revive to full and you could get a bunch of 4&#039;s bots running around and getting in the way.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bob Dukes,

I just beat “Venusian Invasion.&quot; Pump out wave after wave of infantry and sniper bots at the start, and take the building to the south, and the factory to the east.  Then keep pushing forward, capturing with infantry.  The goal is to kill off their soldiers.  Don&#039;t worry too much about bots.  If they don&#039;t have any soldiers, they can&#039;t recap what you take, and you&#039;ll eventually out produce them.]]></description>
