		<description><![CDATA[Hey Larva folk:

My copy seems to have stopped ranking new best words, and only ranks new high scores.  Is there a way to re-set so good words are also ranked in the high score list?  I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;ve beaten some of the words that are there now, but new stuff isn&#039;t showing up.

Also, is there a published formula for how scores are calculated?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Any plans to fix the bugs with the Android version of wordpops? I love the game, but it&#039;s crashing every 3rd or 4th game.  Please post an update soon. I&#039;m hesitant to try any more of your products until I know problems will be adressed.]]></description>
