		<description><![CDATA[I must say and agree with few others here, 

the ability to have slidescreen as main screen is excatly what it made so special and quick to use. If it&#039;s goin to swich now to another launcher just so people could have widgets I presume, then it&#039;s useless I would say.

If I&#039;d like to use jillions of widgets and nice wallpapers and stuff, I wouldn&#039;t eve install slidescreen, I&#039;d just use widgets to show me infro from e-mail, twitter etc ...

Please guys, don&#039;t destroy the brilliant concept of this app.

		<description><![CDATA[This is an extremely informational and elegant launcher. I don&#039;t need a bunch of icons and widgets that suck down my battery.  So this is a great home replacement.  However, at this stage, it crashes way too often.  I notice that most crashes occur when there&#039;s a pop-up of some kind.  For instance, I have Handcent SMS with pop-ups enabled. When I receive a pop-up text with Handcent, SlideScreen would display the crash message.  Or when I return from another app, it will also crash often. It&#039;s only a nuissance because I can press Yes or No at the error log prompt and the crash message will go away.  

Environment:
- Droid X, 2.3.340

Keep up the good work!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like the idea of SlideScreen, but on my Desire HD calender doesn&#039;t load appointment. I use gmail activesync and 5 calenders.

		<description><![CDATA[While I like some of the changes, I hate the &quot;external home screen support&quot; with a passion. It wastes memory, time and it&#039;s counter-intuitive. Suddenly launching apps takes at least one more &quot;clicks&quot;, not to mention the fact that we now have to deal with two different interfaces. This is no longer the app I fell in love with, and purchased :(]]></description>
