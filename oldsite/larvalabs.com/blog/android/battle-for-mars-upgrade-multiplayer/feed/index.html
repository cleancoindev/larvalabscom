		<description><![CDATA[I love this game!
The only things I can think of that would improve it as it stands are..
Most importantly, more multiplayer specific maps (ie balanced).
and something to keep people playing..
Some kind of ranking system. Not for matching, just simply a score for winning/losing and a flat table.
It would just give more of a point and be nice to see your record of wins/losses/kills etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve posted a few comments, but I have been remiss in not saying what an excellent job you&#039;ve done with this game.  Highly entertaining, and with excellent replay value. As others have mentioned, an incredible value for the $5 price. I have another suggestion relating to replay value.  While multi-player has its charms, it would be fun to play as other races in single-player mode.  Perhaps something that could be enabled after completing campaign mode?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m having the same problem as joykiller, actually while playing joykiller.  My &quot;check new turns&quot; only works randomly,  lately, i&#039;ve been able to do only one turn a day.  I assume this is due to the volume of people playing.  I love this game, though i can never beat joykiller :(    Have you ever lost, man?]]></description>

What I find strange is I can connect to the server since I can see my nickname, but not any turn updates and once I reloaded my games its been blank since then even if I try to add a new game :(]]></description>
