																		<p>We&#8217;ve just released a free upgrade for <em>Battle of Mars</em> users on Android. We are excited to report that this version includes support for online multiplayer! You can take part in any number of multiplayer games simultaneously. Each game can have up to four players.</p>
<p>Multiplayer games have the <strong>shroud of war</strong> mode enabled. This means that you can only see what your units and buildings see on the map. This allows for all kinds of sneaky tactics and surprise attacks. We&#8217;ve also tweaked the game engine slightly to rebalance the game and the units. A few details:</p>
<ul>
<li>TechBot can no longer move over mountains. (Didn&#8217;t make any sense!)</li>
<li>TransBot now moves faster and SniperBot now moves slower.</li>
<li>LaserBot is slightly more effective vs. Boats.</li>
<li>Spaceships can now fly through other units (even enemies), but enemies can also advance through them.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are four new maps in there that are specifically designed for multiplayer, but you can also play them as quick maps to get used to them.</p>
<p>One last bonus feature&#8211; you can now quit the game! Before, we used to let the Android OS take care of it automatically, but users indicated that they wanted to be able to quit it manually.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re looking forward to playing in some epic multiplayer games!</p>
<p><strong>v1.52 Update Includes:</strong></p>
<p>Changes for version 1.52 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>New: Use a GTalk login for much improved push turn notification. (Check under Settings > MultiPlayer)</li>
<li>New: Notification controls including &#8211; Only notify of your new turns, and buzz, LED and sound notification controls.</li>
<li>New: Better settings system in general.</li>
<li>Bug fix: Leave game menu option unavailable</li>
<li>Bug fix: Slow startup when in low network connection situation</li>
<li>Bug fix: A few things to do with switching between multiplayer games.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few more details about the GTalk login: First of all this is totally optional. We have a fallback way to try and push turn updates to your phone, but it can get overloaded when a lot of people are playing. Failing that, the app will check for new turns every 30 mins so at least you&#8217;ll find out then. However, if you specify a GTalk login (can be any login, doesn&#8217;t have to be your main GMail account) then that should give you the best experience with real time turn notifications.</p>
<p>The game is also now available on SlideMe for customers outside the Android paid applications area: <a href="https://slideme.org/application/battle-mars">https://slideme.org/application/battle-mars</a></p>
<p><strong>v1.53/4 Update Includes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Crash fixes for a couple situations in game. If you have a multiplayer game that was crashing, try to load it again in the new version.</li>
<li>Two new maps! Both designed specifically for multiplayer, they&#8217;re pretty fun and different from the other maps we&#8217;ve made.</li>
<li>Bug fixes and new LED color for turn notifications. We&#8217;re trying out a nice purple, or at least it&#8217;s purple on the Droid and MyTouch 3G.</li>
<li>New option to turn on shroud of war for single player games too. An extra challenge for the experts out there.</li>
</ul>

				<p>I just started playing the multi-user version. It rocks! </p>
<p>Here are a few suggestions:</p>
<p>-Beginnings are slow as people wait to accrue money and build up defense. Consider more funds to start the game a bit faster (not too much, otherwise the first player has too much of an advantage). While you still have only one factory, you build up faster. Otherwise you just wait many rounds for those Megabots&#8230;</p>
<p>-Some maps are not well balanced. One way could be to auction off who starts. E.g. on Outpost, how much of a handicap are you willing to take to play what in single user mode is the computer? For maps of 3+ the computer should play earthlings (anyone starting a game, that get&#8217;s the worst slot out of the picture)</p>
<p>-Need a “surrender” for multi-user. Otherwise you have to pay to the end, and it’s boring for both. I just destroyed all my units in one game, but it still was a few rounds for a soldier to reach my base. I tried &#8220;Leave game&#8221; and there might be bug here when everybody else already left. I have one game with 3 computers now, and I can&#8217;t get out of that&#8230;</p>
<p>As of the other changes</p>
<p>-I thought of the tech bot as something that can move stuff over mountains, maybe a grav platform. It&#8217;s extremely helpful in many cases to transport. E.g. on &#8220;Steep Ascent&#8221; it helps a lot. Now that you can play the computer in &#8220;Steep Ascent&#8221; I hoped to go around the earthlings and sneak up from behind, but I can&#8217;t get the tech bots out.</p>
<p>-The Spaceship change makes sense, but got me badly. I used them to block off bridges and such. No more&#8230;</p>
<p>-Shroud of war is great. I asked for that a while back. It would be great if you can enable it on single player maps. Or maybe on new maps. Or random maps <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>This continues to be the best game. Tower Raiders came very close, but that will have a hard time beating multi player.</p>

				<p>One more question</p>
<p>==<br />
&#8220;Spaceships can now fly through other units (even enemies), but enemies can also advance through them.&#8221;<br />
==</p>
<p>It looks like I couldn&#8217;t advance through an enemy spaceship&#8230;</p>

				<p>Here is the situation</p>
<p>EMTPY    my Elite Soldier   my War Bot</p>
<p>EMPTY    his Spaceship       Mountain</p>
<p>EMTPY     EMTPY             My Megabot</p>
<p>I wanted to go left and down, then attack. But &#8220;the arrow&#8221; only let me go down and left, which then failed, and I lost my turn for that Elite Soldier.</p>
<p>I also tried to go left, down, down with the War Bot, and that failed, too.</p>

				<p>Hi Louis,</p>
<p>Thanks for the great comments! There is an update available that fixes the movement bug you are talking about. As of 1.51 you should not see that problem you are talking about, let us know if that resolves the issue (it only occurs in multiplayer games). We have some other bugs fixes coming as well shortly.</p>
<p>A few responses to your points:</p>
<p>Slow Beginnings &#8212; They can be a bit slow, but can also be fun if somebody goes for a quick blitz. We are currently improving our notification system which will hopefully speed up the early game a bit.</p>
<p>Surrender &#8212; We are addressing some bug fixes here, but if you &#8220;Leave&#8221; a game (in the menu) then a computer player will take over for you. That way you can exit games where you know it is a lost cause, but still give the other players the satisfaction of cleaning up!</p>
<p>Tech Bot &#8212; True, this hurts the Tech Bot&#8217;s versatility a bit, but we realized that it might have been a bit over-powered before. The ability to carry soldiers over any terrain as well as healing units was a bit much, so we curtailed it just a bit.</p>
<p>Spaceship &#8212; Yes, it was a bit too easy to use spaceships to jam up a bridge before, so this fixes that. It also makes the Battle Pod more deadly, however&#8211; it&#8217;s very hard to keep it away from your prized units now unless you really surround them.</p>
<p>Shroud &#8212; I agree, the game is just better with the shroud on for experienced players. We are going to add a setting that allows the shroud to be turned on in all games.</p>

				<p>There are only two things I could possibly ask for.<br />
One is help solving a bug where, when I have no service, the game sometimes slows to a crawl. I play in the subway and, in many games, if I&#8217;m getting and losing service, the Droid lags a bit, so I&#8217;ll just put it into Airplane mode to solve that altogether, but Battle for Mars seems to just screech to a halt if I do that.</p>
<p>The other is a hot-seat multiplayer. That&#8217;s what I thought this was, at first.. and I got excited that I would be able to play passing the phone back and forth with my girlfriend, but no such luck.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very impressed with multiplayer nonetheless. Great work.</p>

				<p>I am doing Menu-&gt;More and &#8220;single player game&#8221; and &#8220;leave game&#8221; are grayed out. I can&#8217;t select them. This is the case in all the games I tried. What am I missing?</p>

				<p>Confirming that 1.51 fixes movement bug for me. Nice.</p>
<p>More feature suggestions <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>-For multiplayer give an option that says &#8220;end turn and next game&#8221; or &#8220;end game and list new turns&#8221; Currently, I select end turn, then wait (I feel like if I move on too fast, I have to repeat the turn) then menu-&gt;Your Multiplayer Games-&gt;click on first of them.</p>
<p>-I need no notification on other people&#8217;s turn. Only when it&#8217;s my turn again. I think sometimes it tells me that other people did their turn, even if it&#8217;s not my turn yet.</p>

				<p>Awesome feature even though there are some bugs.  Leave game becomes grayed out if you go to a different app and does not come back <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" />  I think I have like 6 games where the players never came back and I can&#8217;t quit them either.  The fog is nice, but it also makes some long range weapons almost useless.</p>

				<p>One last part with the balancing is it would be nice to have maps just for multi, since it is such a fun game.  I know this could be more complicated, but what about an option for a timed or you&#8217;re skipped game?</p>

				<p>Some responses to comments here:</p>
<p>Craig,</p>
<p>We have a fix for the low signal problem you&#8217;re having, should be in the next release. Not sure about the possibilities of hot seat multiplayer, might not be too hard to add so we&#8217;ll consider it.</p>
<p>Louis,</p>
<p>We&#8217;re going to add some options for when to get notified of new turns (basically exactly what you&#8217;re describing). Right now we&#8217;ve got the problem of no notifications getting through, so we&#8217;re going to fix that first then allow people to limit them. And I like that idea for End Turn and Show Next Game. It won&#8217;t be in the next release, but it sounds like a good idea.</p>
<p>JoyKiller,</p>
<p>Maps with an (M) beside them are designed just for multiplayer (and are new to this version). We&#8217;re going to trim that list down a bit as some of the maps just aren&#8217;t fun to play since they&#8217;re so unfair. Sounds like we&#8217;ve got a bug with the leave game menu too, we&#8217;ll check it out.</p>
<p>Glad you guys are liking the game, and thanks for the great and specific feedback!</p>

				<p>Here is another issue to fix asap I&#8217;ve seen this a few times by mistake, and it allows some cheating.</p>
<p>Make all your moves, then menu-your multi-player games, select the same game again, and you get a chance to do the moves again (this time you can avoid that hidden enemy megabot that your sniper bot just run into&#8230;)</p>

				<p>Some more thoughts, after a few more hours <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" />  Getting better and better. I can now leave games, too. The selection of games is better.</p>
<p>The Moat is unbalanced. If Earthlings gets a soldier on the mountain, and a rocket bot, they will will. I haven&#8217;t figured out a strategy against this, as now Red can destroy anything Blue makes, while continuing to make more. I do love the idea, and I was thinking of a similar map, but I think the two bases need to be further apart. Or no rocket bots for this map.</p>

				<p>Yeah, the tiny maps if one side gets a rocket bot, it&#8217;s game over.  But it works the other way around, too.  On &#8216;Exposed&#8217; I just can&#8217;t beat the computer if he builds a RocketBot.</p>

				<p>Many thanks for the multiplayer implementation.  Am really enjoying it.</p>
<p>A couple of bits of feedback:</p>
<p>1. it would be useful to see how long a game has been dormant &#8211; with a lot of games running it is difficult to remember and I like to leave a dormant game after a couple of days</p>
<p>2. flexible starting cash.  further to an early comment, it would be great if the game creator could vary the opening cash.</p>
<p>3. variable gravity.  on some maps can we have a different level of gravity?  this would affect game dynamics.  e.g. in high grav nothing can fly, a standard soldier can only move on square, and artillary has less range.  in low grav soldiers and elites can move faster and artillary goes further .</p>
<p>4. tournies.  you know it makes sense.</p>
<p>5. more maps.  obviously more maps.</p>
<p>6. one-player race selection.  it would be nice to be able to play the (M) maps in one-player mode as another race, just to get some practice in before vlk whips me again.</p>
<p>Thanks for the awesomeness.  You guys rock.</p>

				<p>I was wondering about making a limit to the time you have per turn. After 12 or 24 hours you forfeit your turn or something. It would speed up games, especially multiplayer games when one person just stops, and I&#8217;ve had to quit several 1 vs. 1 games because the other person was losing and stopped playing altogather rather than leave the game.<br />
Some maps are very one sided, maybe a bonus in money for the person who gets the second turn, it seems whoever gets the first turn gets a jump with money.<br />
Otherwise, too much fun, this is way to addictive! My phone gets running out of charge.</p>

				<p>Still quite a few crashes.  I have a few games where the game just dies out trying to show the other player&#8217;s turn or one where the player left, but the computer does not update their games.  All in all this is an awesome upgrade, but still needs a few more tweaks.</p>
<p>Also, what about a turn timer option even if it was something like you get skipped or the computer takes your turn after a day given the notification system I know something like 10 mins would not work, but thought it would be nice to have some options to make sure the game completes.</p>

				<p>Yeah, we&#8217;ve been thinking about instituting a turn time limit and letting people set it up as an option in the game setup screen. We&#8217;re not sure it would help as once a person goes AWOL they don&#8217;t seem to come back, so it might devolve into just a very slow online game vs. the computer. We&#8217;re still considering it though as delinquency is clearly a problem.</p>

				<p>Love the multiplayer feature addition.  The game is finally challenging enough to pick up again.</p>
<p>I have experienced some multiplayer crashes 1.54 in the Water Assault game.  Any way to join a more in depth bug hunting forum where we can give/get more technical details?</p>
<p>Thx again for a good strategy game.</p>

				<p>On the topic of turn time limit:<br />
I have stopped playing turn based online games which &#8220;required&#8221; my attention (travian, etm.) so the addition of time limit SHOULD be optional.  Usually it&#8217;s not an issue but I&#8217;m sure it will be an inconvenience for some.</p>

				<p>I have noticed a difference in unit mini menu behavior between single player and multiplayer modes in v1.54.  </p>
<p>Setup:<br />
Checking the unit range / attack options upon the second &#8220;select&#8221; click of a unit.</p>
<p>Single player game allows one to back out and not commit that unit to moving whereas multiplayer mode doesn&#8217;t allow one to back out of the mini menu and uses up that unit&#8217;s turn.  </p>

				<p>I know its a tricky one with time limits but for me at least for the games where it is close, but after a few days and a hundred moves the other player disappears or the game crashes when one of us try to move and we get stuck.</p>
<p>On a different note have you given any thought to a ranking or tracking system?  I think that would add in some additional incentive for people to finish as well.</p>

				<p>Another couple of suggestions:</p>
<p>1. It should not be possible to see the other players&#8217; funds with the shroud of war, and with them showing it is possible to figure out exactly what they are building each turn, especially in Stretched Resources, where both players earn a consistent 40 bucks per turn.</p>
<p>2. The variable range of visibility within the shroud is great, especially when you put a scout on a mountain.  However, logically a scout on a mountain should not be able to see beyond the next mountain.  The Moat especially suffers from this problem, where you can watch your opponent&#8217;s factory.</p>
<p>A fix would turn Rugged Terrain into hand to hand fighting, which would be kinda interesting, and would bring airbourne units back into the mix.</p>

				<p>Two more things to note:</p>
<p>1. I had my girlfriend start playing campaign mode and I was dismayed to find that, after starting the first level, all the other campaign levels locked up again! Frustrating!</p>
<p>2. Has anyone noticed that, in the &#8220;Battle for Mars&#8221;, you play as the Earthlings? Presumably the &#8220;Martians&#8221; are the indigenous people, right? Are we invading Mars, systematically eradicating its natives? That&#8217;s not very nice of us. But I suppose when in interstellar domination &#8220;Nice&#8221; doesn&#8217;t come into it..</p>

				<p>Great game, guys. I&#8217;m really enjoying getting my butt kicked by everyone but the computer. <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  </p>
<p>I wonder if you could provide a time-lapse replay showing everyone&#8217;s moves over the course of the just-finished game.  Remove the shroud of war after the game and see what everyone was up to.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work!</p>

				<p>By the way; could someone explain the different colors under the attack strength vs chart?  I understand the bar length, but the colors are confusing me.  I bet it&#8217;s something totally obvious&#8230;.</p>

				<p>The last set of changes ruined a few maps, such as &#8220;Territorial Battle&#8221;.  Since the computer no longer starts with any units, and their command center is on an island, after 3 units blue just gets stuck.  Now all I have to do is spam soldiers building to take over the Venusians and take care of a blue ships and thats it.  I would assume this is supposed to be the 2nd hardest map.</p>
<p>Any chance of you guys working on an expansion pack?  Some new units?  Soldiers w/missiles, mines, engineers (build roads through mountains).  medics, can only cure other soldiers, have same stats, but cost 3x for example.</p>

				<p>Oh forgot to mention:  </p>
<p>People love rankings, achievements, extra challenges.<br />
Beat game in # of moves (PAR type system)<br />
Loose less than X number of units.<br />
Loose no units (supreme commander)<br />
beat game using only soldiers</p>
<p>that type of thing. You would be surprised how much more fun you would add to your game.  Also, keeping track of stats of some sort would greatly add to the fun.</p>

				<p>First of all this is an excellent game, the best on Android without a doubt. Fantasitc value for my $5!. It&#8217;s addictively fun. I’ve only played single player so I don’t know about the Multiplayer side but I&#8217;m keen to try it (I live in an area with no WiFi and very expensive 3G). </p>
<p>The tactics and variety are great, I have had a lot of game play out of it. The difficulty of the scenarios varies – some are extremely hard, some are trivially easy. But generally they are challenging without being frustrating. Of course, the AI could be smarter, but it’s not bad. I would definitely recommend buying this game. Some suggestions for AI and mechanics improvements:</p>
<p>Mechanics:</p>
<p>- The combat results prediction should show expected friendly damage as well as enemy damage<br />
- Would be nice to have 2 units swap places – this is a common fault with almost all games of this type though<br />
- Aircraft should be able to occupy the same square as surface units. At the moment aircraft and surface units are mutually exclusive in the same square. Not only is this unrealistic but it allows unrealistic tactics – using aircraft to occupy a square to prevent access by surface units, or to channel or pin surface units, or blocking surface units with a damaged (1-2 strength) air unit. Aircraft should not block the presence of surface units, and vice versa. Units in the same hex should be able to attack each other (if capable). I&#8217;ve built a whole game winning strategy out of this abuse of air units, but it&#8217;s not very realistic.<br />
- There is no sea unit with any anti-air capability (or does the Doom Boat have anti-air?). Nice to have, not essential.<br />
- It’s realistic for the artillery (Bomb Bot, Rocket Bot) to have a minimum range, but the anti air unit (Laser Bot) should not have a minimum range. It makes this unit hard to use and easy to defeat. An attacking aircraft just closes easily to point blank range and attacks with impunity. You need at least 3 Laser Bots to defeat this tactic. It’s bad gameplay and also unrealistic since, unlike artillery, air defence weapons don’t have minimum ranges (not on this scale), and lasers don’t follow ballistic paths. </p>
<p>AI:</p>
<p>The AI is not good at spotting threats to its Command Center. This should be treated like “Check” in chess – all other priorities are secondary to countering this threat. The highest threat is an infantry unit in capture range of an unoccupied Command Center. But non-infantry units occupying the Command Center, or infantry units supported by other units that could kill the unit defending the Command Center, should also be treated as paramount threats.</p>
<p>Also the AI is not good at defending its production centres (Factory, Navy yard, Spaceport). Occupying these centres, even without capturing them, shuts down production and is a game winning tactic that the AI is blind to (both on defence and offence).</p>
<p>The AI will walk or build units into range of Rocket Bots or other ranged weapons that can kill them instantly. That is just dumb unless you have lots and lots of these units. The AI should priorities its own units, and not make such mistakes with its most valuable units, unless it has them to spare and good reasons for deploying them. </p>
<p>The AI often makes seemingly pointless suicide attacks, attacking with a strength 2 unit against a strength 10. But possibly it does have justification for doing this, as sometimes it does do the right thing and pull units back to base areas to rebuild. </p>
<p>The AI is very bad at fighting wars on too many fronts. Even when it is on its knees, an AI player will keep fighting wars against many other opponents in remote parts of the world. It needs to know when it’s losing a war in its home territory, and pull forces and resources back to defending the core.</p>
<p>I often see the AI accumulating points, even when it is at the brink of defeat, and extra units could come in handy. Is it saving up for a Flying City? </p>
<p>In general perhaps the AI lacks of sense of &#8220;I&#8217;m doing well&#8221;, &#8220;I&#8217;m doing OK&#8221;, &#8220;I&#8217;m getting my butt kicked&#8221;. It needs different stances for different situations. Building a super weapon is fine if you have the upper hand, or in a stalemate, but not if you&#8217;re up against the wall and losing cities every turn.</p>

				<p>More suggestion on Mechanics: I don&#8217;t think that Elite Soldiers should be weaker than regular Soldiers ina straight fight (they are half the attack strength). Or, if they are to be weaker than a regular Soldier unit, rename them Specialists (since they can fight armour, boats and aircraft). Generally I hardly ever buy Elite Soldiers, since they are less mobile and less powerful than regular Soldiers. Soldiers are much better in a pure infantry fight, and Elite are not much use against Robots anyway. I only use them for guard duty in buildings (especially Spaceports or Naval yards), or if I know the enemy are almost all robots. </p>
<p>In some other games, if a transport (Transport Boat, TechBot, TransBot) is damaged, the unit(s) being carried would take proportional damage. But I kind of like your way of doing it &#8211; if the transport survives at all, the unit is undamaged, kind of like the transport is an &#8220;outer shell&#8221;. Think about this one, but actually the current mechanic is fine. </p>
<p>Also, some bugs and other oddments:</p>
<p>You can stack an infinite (or large at least) number of TechBots inside each other, all in one turn, with a single contained non-TechBot unit at the core of the stack. It&#8217;s not much of an exploit, since it takes you 1 turn for each step of unpacking one more TechBot. More of a curiosity. </p>
<p>You can also put soldiers inside a TransBot inside a TechBot (or a Transport). I presume this is intended &#8211; I think it&#8217;s a good thing. </p>
<p>I sort of second the view that TechBots could cross mountains, maybe with a movement rate of only 1 per turn. But mountain crossing is one of the unique points of Soldiers, so maybe not. </p>
<p>The Help description for TransBot should make it clear that it can only carry soldiers. (It says &#8220;units&#8221;.)</p>
<p>You might want a double-check dialog on End Turn. The reason is if you are clicking quickly on Attack, and a ranged unit is unexpectedly out of range of any targets, you hit End Turn instead and there are no take-backs. </p>
<p>Nice to have &#8211; if you click a friendly unit, then click an enemy unit that&#8217;s not in range, you see the Expected Combat Results, of what would happen IF that attack could take place. Maybe flash up &#8220;out of range&#8221; while showing the combat results.</p>

				<p>An example of a trivially easy scenario, vs the AI, is Stretched Resources. Or does the (M) mean this is only for multiplayer? Anyway, on single player, the following approach works every time (SPOILER ALERT!):</p>
<p>-Build SniperBot to race to first cover your Command, then move on to hold enemy Command.</p>
<p>-Then build Soldier (or Elite, no difference), then TransBot. Send the Soldier and TransBot to capture the enemy Command, while the SniperBot holds it against attack.</p>
<p>-Now build BombBot and SniperBots to easily repel the feeble attacks on your Factory coming slowly through the forest from the enemy Factory. </p>
<p>This works every time, victory in 7 turns without fail. I guess what the AI needs to do is prioritise the safety of its Command Center, always calculate how soon you could take his Command Center, and send reinforcements there asap. He should not initiate an attack unless his own Command Center is no longer at risk.</p>

				<p>Bug report &#8211; game hangs in single player mode on Battle of 4 Armies during AI turn, Venusians turn. They are down to 1 Soldier (full strength) in Command, Factory empty and surrounded by Martians. City also empty. I guess the AI is in a loop trying to decide its actions. </p>
<p>Enemy Direction &#8211; Type &#8211; Strength </p>
<p>North &#8211; Warbot &#8211; 7<br />
West &#8211; Soldier &#8211; 5<br />
South &#8211; Soldier &#8211; 4</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a shame as I was enjoying the game.</p>

				<p>Another minor bug: I switch away from a game I&#8217;ve won. Then I switch back to it. I can now move units (normally disabled after Victory) and end my turn. The alien turn comes, and hangs.</p>
<p>Re The Moat, it&#8217;s not curtains if the enemy gets a RocketBot. You can still build Gunboats and Doomboats in your Navy yard to fight back. However you should be able to beat a computer opponent reliably before it can build a RocketBot, or certainly force it to spend on defense instead.</p>

				<p>I see that there has been substantial discussion about incorporating a timer for multiplayer, whether this should be optional or not, etc.  I have a simple suggestion for this. If a player has not made a move within 1 week, then boot them from the game, and revert their forces to computer control.  If they&#8217;ve gone that long, then they must have lost interest, lost their phone, or something similar.  This seems to me to be fair to everyone else.</p>

				<p>I just want to shout out to Retrobution311 if he/she reads the blog that your recent tactic using the tech bot was fantastic. Had I not messed up by accidentally hitting &#8220;end turn&#8221; twice in the past 5, I would have crushed you already. <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />   Can&#8217;t wait to see what happens when you take over my command center, even though I already have another&#8230;<br />
Nicely done!</p>

				<p>Weird bug&#8230;</p>
<p>Not sure if anyone has had this happen but my turns won&#8217;t register for a couple games with one player magic. There are 2 games probably at least 50 turns each but when I hit end turn it acts like it is ok, but if I reload the games they come back as if I did nothing.  Also one has a computer going next, but it never shows up which how I also know nothing is getting taken.</p>
<p>Otherwise I love the game just wish there was a way to finish some of the games in multi and maybe a scoreboard <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

				<p>Same deal with me. The comp players seem to take their time. And yes I will echo Joykiller in saying that the game needs a score count for the players. Other than that it&#8217;s an awesome game. Thanks for making it!</p>

				<p>I periodically (maybe once per game on average) have a bug where I will target one unit with a ranged attack (usually a rocketbot). I select the unit to attack, it goes through the animation, but when the game exits the animation screen, it applies the damage to a different unit. It is always another unit that is within range  A couple of times I&#8217;ve had a case where there was no other unit in range, so the damage just disappeared.  Very irritating.  I&#8217;m playing on a G1, by the way.</p>

				<p>Got the game a while ago and love it. Though for some reason now it keeps giving me a force to close error. I could not figure out why. Heck even did a factory reset and reinstall. Same issue, but it turns out there is a new version, 1.55. I found it odd google did not automatically tell me there was an update available but the downside is after I update it, it still crashes.</p>
<p>I have the LG Ally running android 2.1-update 1.</p>

				<p>I strongly suggest that something be done about timing out turns in multi-player.  I am in three multi-player games at the moment.  One of them is down to 2 players (originally 4).  The other player frequently takes a week or more between moves. In another, we have been waiting for one of 4 players to make his first move for 2 weeks. At least in the 3rd game, we only need about a week to get through moves for 3 of us.  So, this is obviously a serious problem.  Some posts here recommend that the computer take a move if it has been dormant for a day or two. I suggest the player be removed from the game if it has been dormant for a week. This should not be optional, out of respect to the other players.</p>

				<p>Thanks for the update and it seemed to allow me to get one game going again, but another is still stuck on the server not taking my turn with Magic.  Everytime I reload it pops up again, but then the computer never goes and rinse and repeat.</p>

				<p>It&#8217;s not just slow like it gets sometimes, but is not updating at all since Thursday. What I find strange is I can connect to the server since I can see my nickname, but not any turn updates and once I reloaded my games its been blank since then even if I try to add a new game <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

				<p>I&#8217;m having the same problem as joykiller, actually while playing joykiller.  My &#8220;check new turns&#8221; only works randomly,  lately, i&#8217;ve been able to do only one turn a day.  I assume this is due to the volume of people playing.  I love this game, though i can never beat joykiller <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" />     Have you ever lost, man?</p>

				<p>I&#8217;ve posted a few comments, but I have been remiss in not saying what an excellent job you&#8217;ve done with this game.  Highly entertaining, and with excellent replay value. As others have mentioned, an incredible value for the $5 price. I have another suggestion relating to replay value.  While multi-player has its charms, it would be fun to play as other races in single-player mode.  Perhaps something that could be enabled after completing campaign mode?</p>

				<p>I love this game!<br />
The only things I can think of that would improve it as it stands are..<br />
Most importantly, more multiplayer specific maps (ie balanced).<br />
and something to keep people playing..<br />
Some kind of ranking system. Not for matching, just simply a score for winning/losing and a flat table.<br />
It would just give more of a point and be nice to see your record of wins/losses/kills etc.</p>
