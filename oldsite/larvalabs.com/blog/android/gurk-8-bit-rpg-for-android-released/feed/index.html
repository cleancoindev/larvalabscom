		<description><![CDATA[Hi.

just wanted to say i love the game. Thank you for putting it. I know that you do not have time, but is it possible to get a sandbox version to build new maps or storylines ?
Maybe you can use the community to develop it.

I am interested to help.

		<description><![CDATA[Loved it! You guys rock! Game&#039;s Awesome. I must add my voice to the masses. Please make more for this game. Maybe have Braka re-appear somewhere else only stronger and increase the rest of the monsters difficulty accordingly. It would be great if one would actually need Braka&#039;s Wand now that I have it, Or the Sword of Power (or as I call it, &quot;The Sword of Holy Crapness&quot;. Thus called because when enemies see it they exclaim, &quot;Holy Crap! He has the sword!&quot;

C&#039;mooooon Guys...What&#039;ll it take? 40 maybe 50 lines of code? If Braka=dead then monster hp = monster hp x2, Shop and dropped items attributes = shop and dropped items attributes x2, Braka re-spawns @ Gray Citadel. 

You can do it, It would be cake for coders of your caliber...:)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love such kind of games but I find Gurk rather unbalanced. After surviving first few battles and getting some money to buy some equipment the battles started to be very easy becaue archer was able to destroy most of the enemies without making any contact.
But the later part is pretty hard as encountering 10 skeleton wizards or even kings with level 7 party. So either too easy or too hard, nothing between.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Loved the game. Thank you. Please consider developing the game further. It is worth paying for.  :)

PS If this helps someone, the entrance to the third level of the dragon&#039;s lair is kinda hidden in the second level.  I had to look twice. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great game! 

As &quot;pedro&quot; said, is it posible to insert new maps, stuf, dungeons or missions? Is the code free to downloading and see/modify it?

Thank you!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed this game. I feel a little sad that it ended abruptly with killing Braka and I dont think its the kind of game you wanna start over on. I read ur post about not further developing this game and I think its kind of sad since it was really entertaining and I&#039;d love some sort of continuation with a change of scenery (like a desert?). Anyhoo, thanks for the game!]]></description>
