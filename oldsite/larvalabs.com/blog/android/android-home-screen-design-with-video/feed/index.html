		<description><![CDATA[I plan to return my droid tomorrow. My main complaint is that it does not have a screen like the one you are proposing (plus the on/off switch is annoying me. I have to be able to connect a beep with information as soon as possible and your app would do that nicely. Sux for me : ( back to my beloved moto Q for now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just upgraded from the palm treo to the andriod and this is 
kinda simular to the app on the palm which I truely miss.
I am use to having everything displayed on my home screen. I would definetely  buy this app. Email if you need a tester and/or  when you  release it. Also it would be nice if
it had an option to increase font size in each colored
category and a  speech feedback option to boot.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Information is the next dimension in UI, not flashy 3d effects. I would want to go even further: instead of the random pile of app icons, sort them into categories. 
Some other ideas:
Don&#039;t always show me my stocks; I don&#039;t always have room for that. But show me once they go up/down more than 5%. That&#039;s important. 
I get tons of emails because of all the mailing lists...I only want to be notified about the important ones, like the one from my boss. Weather: doesn&#039;t really matter if it&#039;s 65 or 75 degrees but I really gotta know if there&#039;s a big storm ahead.
Link to eBay: tell me if I just made the winning bid.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This looks like an awesome homescreen!  Coming from a Blackberry to Android would be so much easier for me with an app like this, as I am used to having everything displayed on my home screen, and I definitely miss that.

Please make this app!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A phone with a bunch of silly pretty gadget is worthless to a person over the age of 25.  This intelligent home screen would destroy the outdated Blackberry market.  I would easily pay up to $20  to have this homescreen just to take me away from being a blackberry user.

Please develop this.   I remember when I purchased the Tour from Verizon without a Today theme, there were complaints on every forum and people asking for it left and right.

Please develop it.]]></description>
