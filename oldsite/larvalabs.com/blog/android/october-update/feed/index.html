		<description><![CDATA[Larva!  So incredibly excited the project will continue on to release!  I will be buying this screen IMMEDIATELY at virtually any cost.  Seriously, I&#039;d be willing to invest money just to see this project through.

Your mock-ups look beautiful, profound and very sophisticated.  Please, please don&#039;t change your mind on releasing.  I have many of my friends and coworkers excited for the release.

I have been and will continue to check back here often for updates.  Great work!

		<description><![CDATA[An idea for the home screen:

I suppose there will be just just one main screen in the application. So while, with the usual screen of android, when be scrolling rigth or left you have acces to an other screen, do you think with that function you could create a quick acces to an application?

For example: scrolling the screen to left will launch contact application and scrolling it to the right will launch the web browser.

I hope i made myself enough clear.

Anyway this will be a great app and ready to pay what will be necessary to get it !]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In reference to one of your earlier post “The ultimate version of this idea is a full customized version of most of the Android stock apps to integrate with and to look like the main design.”  You also felt that “This kind of deep customization is not really possible if we were to release it as a home screen replacement via the market.”  Since you now may release the home screen on the market, has the ultimate version been compromised?  

Or, since you hinted that Verizon and Motorola may be reading the blog, is it possible you have found a partner to help fully develop the UI?

Of course I’m not asking you to discuss your business.  I’m just giddy about the home screen!]]></description>

Hopefully Droid busts this whole thing wide open and everyone will follow.]]></description>
