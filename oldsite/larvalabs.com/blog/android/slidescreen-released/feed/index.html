		<description><![CDATA[Very impressed guys.  I&#039;ve just made this my default homescreen.

Runs very smoothly on my Samsung Galaxy S, no stuttering.

More interactivity would be great (ie. being able to &#039;like&#039;/comment on facebook updates, be able to send sms directly to contacts&#039; birthdays the Calendar - mine is jam packed with birthdays uploaded from Facebook).

Can&#039;t wait for the next release!]]></description>

For some reasons, the calendar entries are not showing up on the SlideScreen in my HTC Desire. This problem seems to be unique to HTC Sense phones. Any workarounds?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Mike,

Get the latest update to SlideScreen Pro that fixes the problem. There was a change to Google Reader&#039;s credentials system that caused the problem.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Guys,

I&#039;m having problems with the Google Reader in SS Pro. Currently, it keeps saying it needs my Login information, even though I&#039;ve supplied it a valid password and checked the Google Reader site to make sure that&#039;s working. Annoying.

		<description><![CDATA[So I&#039;m having a problem. Here&#039;s how I produced it.

1) Installed SlideScreen
2) Made it my default home button replacement.
3) Went in to applications, SlideScreen, cleared defaults for the app.
4) Made the Android &#039;home&#039; the default home button location again.
5) Can&#039;t figure out how to make SlideScreen default again.
6) uninstalled and re-installed slidescreen. 

Can&#039;t get the device to re-prompt me whether or not I want to my slidescreen my default home app.

Any help?

		<description><![CDATA[Awesome!

I&#039;ve just ordered the N1 and will buy this right along with it if it works, looks and feels as brilliant as it seems to do.

Hang in there guys, the Android market will someday mature and provide you with some well earned cold hard cash.]]></description>
