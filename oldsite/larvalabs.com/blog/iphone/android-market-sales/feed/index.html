		<description><![CDATA[Ok so I have only read half of these comments and noticed that most of the comments must come from Apple portable users(iphone, ipad, itouch &amp; ipod) due to the pro-apple stance (n.b. I use a macbook and an Android mobile) so it seems a little basis. 


Ok before I get into the apps a little history lesson for starters, Linux was developed before Apple was. The co-founders of Linux believed and most of the developers today still believe in a free information society, ok not so glossy like Apple but functional and stable applications (n.b if your an Android mobile user and downloaded an app that has crashed its not an official app) and OS (operating system), note though while this is true Apple&#039;s whole OS comes from this exact family so while you guys are arguing over who the better brother or sister it is some what trivial.
They are completely different operating systems designed for different purposes(originally)!!


Lets move to more the fact of who makes more money obviously Apple. 
Why? marketing and knowing their niche not to mention expanding their capabilities on how to purchase stuff(apps, music &amp; etc) with gift cards and credit cards.

But, which of you can honestly say they have bought everything via credit card or gift card over the internet, as in never once downloaded a free commercial music track or a dvd or movie that hasn&#039;t come out yet or you&#039;ve been to lazy to get up off ur @ss and go to a store and buy it. 

At one time or another you have downloaded information for free and Google knows that this is a on-going fact of the information age and money has never been tighter so it comes to reason &quot;why charge?&quot; when some crack is going to break the app himself and offer it to others for free.

While the design and layout of both are different and the charge or not to charge factor IMHO (in my honest opinion) I strongly disagree that the war on mobiles is far from over and Google&#039;s Android OS and phones will be around for a long time to come Apple might be &quot;HOT&quot; now but once the phase passes so will their phones unless they start changing tactics to keep themselves up-to-date in the future of leaking free information society we are only just starting.

Thanks for reading .... let me kno what ya&#039;s think post anon2010]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The only thing I agree about here is the buying of apps as it’s not as easy as one would like. I personally am not lazy nor an idiot so I found the process easier than hell. 
The developers of free apps are helping Google make more money and not getting a cut.

This is just like a lot of the open source software. Companies use developers to create commodity markets for their own gain, and the developers don’t get any part of this profit. These poor develpers don’t even realize they are being used.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am sure that the android market is a loss for anyone who believes he can make money there. But it is not about the limited description or the missing screenshots. The problem is, that only customers of a few country can buy applications from the market. I see only a fraction of the applications and I think this is a real pitty, because I would pay for a good application if I just could. So it is about the programmers to consider another payment schemes (e.g. license codes) as long as google allows that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Perhaps they should open Android Market for paid apps in more countries. Here in Sweden it is not possible to buy Apps from the market, you can only download free apps. So naturally free apps will be much more popular.

If you want to make money on Android you should probably work on porting it to new platforms, or extend its functionality so that it supports some kind of hardware you make.. E.g. a keyboard maker could extend Android to support keyboards and try to sell the idea to phone manufacturers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m coming from the sales world and I know alot about buying habits . I have had both I phone and android phones. I believe the main reason i phone has larger app. sales is because in order to even use your phone you have to connect it to an i tunes account and to have an i tunes account it has to be connected to your credit card. So when people first get the phone it is already connected to a credit card and out of the excitement of having a new phone they of course browse the app. store and want the hottest downloads. they begin with the free, but its so easy to go ahead and click ok to purchase a pay version. Once the phone is set up you never have to pull your card out again]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t get why every one keep harping on a great Android platform great hardware and all, but failed to look to the number of quality apps put out by developers on both ends.

As a normal worker i demand a device that enables me to increase my productivity. 

If you make a phone faster than the iphone, bigger screen then the iphone, have a better camera than an iphone, it will suck if no one produces quality apps to take advantage of them!

My humble thoughts why the Android Market is a broken model &gt;&gt; http://www.productiveorganizer.com/iphone-ecosystem/why-the-android-market-is-a-broken-model/]]></description>
